## Continuity Ledger (compaction-safe)
Maintain a single Continuity Ledger for this workspace in `CONTINUITY.md`. The ledger is the canonical session briefing designed to survive context compaction; do not rely on earlier chat text unless it’s reflected in the ledger.

### Article-writing ledger (separate from the repo ledger)
- Keep using the root `CONTINUITY.md` as the canonical **repository** ledger (build/product decisions, implementation state).
- Use `texts/CONTINUITY.md` as the canonical **article-writing** ledger (drafting state, outline-to-draft progress, publishing constraints).
- When working on the blog post in `texts/*`, update `texts/CONTINUITY.md` in addition to (or instead of) the root ledger, depending on what changed.

### How it works
- At the start of every assistant turn: read `CONTINUITY.md`, update it to reflect the latest goal/constraints/decisions/state, then proceed with the work.
- **After every file edit: update `CONTINUITY.md` immediately** to reflect the change before proceeding to the next task. Skipping this breaks session continuity and makes context unreliable.
- Keep it short and stable: facts only, no transcripts. Prefer bullets. Mark uncertainty as `UNCONFIRMED` (never guess).
- If you notice missing recall or a compaction/summary event: refresh/rebuild the ledger from visible context, mark gaps `UNCONFIRMED`, ask up to 1–3 targeted questions, then continue.

### `functions.update_plan` vs the Ledger
- `functions.update_plan` is for short-term execution scaffolding while you work (a small 3–7 step plan with pending/in_progress/completed).
- `CONTINUITY.md` is for long-running continuity across compaction (the “what/why/current state”), not a step-by-step task list.
- Keep them consistent: when the plan or state changes, update the ledger at the intent/progress level (not every micro-step).

### In replies
- Begin with a brief “Ledger Snapshot” (Goal + Now/Next + Open Questions). Print the full ledger only when it materially changes or when the user asks.
